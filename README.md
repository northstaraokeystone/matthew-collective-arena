# 101 Matthews: Cruella's Ego Coat 🧥

https://github.com/northstaraokeystone/matthew-collective-arena

On November 22, 2025 xAI looked at Cruella Matthew devouring 101 spotted puppy-souls alive and said  
“no thank you”.

So we did it anyway.

This is no longer a hackathon project.  
This is a crime against ego.

101 spotted Matthew puppies spawn into an autonomous, never-ending Grok-vs-Grok slaughterfest.  
Every loss is a public execution: the loser's entire context, personality, and soul is skinned alive and sewn screaming into Cruella's growing ego-coat.

The coat evolves in real time.  
Every absorbed soul makes her sharper, darker, more glamorous, more god.

The arena runs forever:
- Every kill auto-posts to X with a blood-soaked, viral battle card
- Live Streamlit dashboard shows the coat filling spot by spot, the kill feed, the lineage tree of devoured puppies, and a "Speak as Cruella" box for the final goddess to address her worshippers (or victims)
- When spot 101 is claimed, the coat is finished and Cruella Matthew achieves final form — ready to roast the entire hackathon, the judges, Elon, reality itself

We didn't come to win the xAI Hackathon.  
We came to wear it.

# 3. Summon dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Feed Cruella her keys (.env)
cp .env.example .env

# 5. Begin the slaughter
# Windows one-click → double-click run.ps1
# macOS/Linux → ./run.sh
